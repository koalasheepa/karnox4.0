Both of them offers a great sitting experience, but their different looks and feels make them suited to different use case.Karnox 2.0 PU leather has glossiness, plumpness and surface planeness. Also, it is water-resistant, so long as gently cleans, then maintains cleanly.If you frequently perspire while sitting, you might prefer the Livorno Fabric. The unique soft texture combines two-tone fiber sand technology and long fiber dyeing technology, which makes Livorno is elegant in texture and soft to the touch. Meanwhile, it’s also highly breathable to reduce the build-up of heat.Karnox’s high quality castors are made of Nylon and Polyurethane that offer exceptional movement on both soft and hard floors, especially the COMMANDER and GLADIATOR’s castors are made from full PU leather offers more stability. Also, the Polyurethane 4D adjustable armrests offer a wide range of movement allowing for you to be comfortable in any position.<\/p>"

            "text": "<p>Our castors are suitable for both soft and hard floors. They can be moved easily on both carpet and hard floors. However, the damage to hard floors is not primarily caused by the caster themselves but dust grains adhere to the casters changing the characteristics to a “grainy“ feeling. This causes the surface of the castors to become rough and when rubbed against laminate, wood, or similar flooring can cause damage. To prevent damage to hard floors, we recommend a protective mat. Thanks to the roll characteristics of our castors, a plastic or fabric option is viable to protect your floor.<\/p>"
